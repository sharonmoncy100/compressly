        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Last updated: <strong>Dec 4, 2025</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Compressly</strong> is a free, privacy-first image compressor. This page explains what data we
            collect (if any), how we use it, and what choices you have.</p>

        <h2>Key points - short summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All image compression happens locally in your browser. We do <strong>not</strong> upload your images to
                any server.</li>
            <li>We do not require accounts or personal information to use the tool.</li>
            <li>We may collect minimal usage analytics (anonymous) to improve the site - see details below.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Compressly works (privacy details)</h2>
        <p>When you choose an image, the file stays in your device memory and the compression happens inside your
            browser (client-side). We never send your images to our servers. That means your photos remain private and
            never leave your device unless you explicitly download or share them.</p>

        <h2>What we do collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No personal images or files:</strong> images you compress are not uploaded or stored on our
                servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal analytics:</strong> we may use Vercel Analytics (and/or Speed Insights) and Google
                Search Console to measure visits and performance. These tools collect aggregated, non-personal
                information such as page views, device type and general location (city/region, not exact coordinates).
                This is used only to improve the site.</li>
            <li><strong>Error logging:</strong> for site stability we may capture anonymous errors (stack traces without
                user content). We do not tie this to your image files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>We do not use tracking cookies for advertising. If any small cookies are set for analytics or platform
            operation, they are minimal, safe, and used only to measure site performance (not to track individuals
            across sites). If you prefer, you can block cookies in your browser.</p>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>We rely on third-party services for hosting and analytics (for example, Vercel for hosting and Speed Insights
            / analytics). These services have their own privacy policies. We recommend checking their policies if you
            want full details.</p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you do not want to be included in anonymous analytics, you can use an ad-blocker or disable
                third-party cookies in your browser.</li>
            <li>Do not upload or share images you do not want to keep private - the site does not store or forward
                images, but always keep local backups if needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Compressly is not intended for medical or highly sensitive images. For extremely
            sensitive images consider offline professional software or trusted internal tools.
