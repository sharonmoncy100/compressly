        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <p>
            These terms explain how Compressly works and what you agree to when using the site.
            By using Compressly, you accept these terms. If you don't agree with them, please
            avoid using the tool.
        </p>

        <h2>What Compressly does</h2>
        <p>
        Compressly is a simple browser-based image compression tool. All image processing
        happens directly in your browser. Your images are not uploaded to our servers,
        stored, or shared with anyone.
        </p>

    <h2>Using the tool</h2>
    <p>
        Compressly is provided as a self-service utility. You are free to use it for personal
        or professional purposes, as long as your use is lawful.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for the images you choose to compress.</li>
        <li>You should only use images that you own or have permission to use.</li>
        <li>You must not use the service for illegal, harmful, or abusive content.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>File size and acceptance</h2>
    <p>
        While Compressly helps reduce image file sizes, we cannot guarantee that every
        compressed image will be accepted by all websites, portals, or government services.
        Different platforms have different rules, and those rules can change.
    </p>
    
    <h2>No warranties</h2>
    <p>
        Compressly is provided “as is”. We do our best to keep the tool accurate and reliable,
        but we do not make any guarantees about results, performance, or availability.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Limitation of responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        We are not responsible for any losses, rejections, or issues that may occur from
        using compressed images. This includes application rejections, quality concerns,
        or technical problems outside our control.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Availability of the service</h2>
    <p>
        The website may be updated, changed, or temporarily unavailable at times.
        We may also modify or discontinue parts of the service without prior notice.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Updates to these terms</h2>
    <p>
        These terms may be updated occasionally. If changes are made, continued use of
        Compressly means you accept the updated terms.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Contact</h2>
